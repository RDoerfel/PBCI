# PBCI
## Canonical Correlation Based BCI

The code provides offline aclassification algorithms for the provided benchmark dataset. Imlpemented are:

 1. CCA: simple CCA based classification
 2. FBCCA: Ensamble classifier using frequency subbands to increase contribution by harmonics
 3. Extended CCA: Ensamlbe classifier based approach taking subject specific training data into account
 4. Extended FBCCA: combination of FBCCA and extended CCA
 
Further, the Repository contains shell scripts to run the files on the HPC (Supercomputer) at DTU. These scipts take variables as well, to simplify running with different parameters.
